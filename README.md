# Jeremy's Adventure
I made this game for a school project.
It took me 2 weeks.
There are 2 characters.
You must use the z,q,s,d and up,down,left,right key to make them move.
To win, the hero must get the key and touch the princess but he mustn't be touched by the wicked.

Here is 2 images of the game:
